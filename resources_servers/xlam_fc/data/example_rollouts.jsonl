The function has parameters like network_ids, release_date_start, and sort_by. \n\nThe user specified networks '1' and '8', so I should set network_ids to \"1,8\". The release date should be after 2010, so release_date_start needs to be 20100101.

But I need to make sure that the parameters I do set are correctly formatted. \n\nWait, the release_date_start default is 20010101, but the user wants after 2010. So changing that to 20100101.
